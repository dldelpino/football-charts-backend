# Football Charts - Backend

This repository contains the backend for my [Football Charts](dldelpino.github.io/football-charts) web application. It has been developed with [FastAPI](fastapi.tiangolo.com) and [SQLModel](sqlmodel.tiangolo.com).

The `database.db` file contains all the necessary data for matches, standings, leagues and teams, and it is automatically generated by running the script `app.py`. Match data has been scraped from CSV files provided by [football-data.co.uk](football-data.co.uk), while the rest of the data has been calculated from that match data.

The API is deployed on [Render](render.com) at https://football-charts-backend.onrender.com.
